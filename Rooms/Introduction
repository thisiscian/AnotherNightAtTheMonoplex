You are Sarah. People think that's a bland name, but you happen to disagree.
Would someone so bland dare to go to the cinema on a TUESDAY NIGHT?!
Perhaps they would, but that's just a coincidence, you tell yourself.

You step into your favourite (and most local) cinema. It is called the Monoplex.
It might cost a little more than the chain cinemas, but you like to think that helping local businesses is important.
Plus, the ambience here is really nice.
Plus, the chairs are super comfortable.

Normally, you like to watch medieval non-fiction romance sagas, but tonight you feel like you could watch any of the films that are on.
Would a bland Sarah do such a wild thing?
You hope not.

With all the wanton cash in your pocket (a solid 20), you prepare yourself for another night at the Monoplex.
