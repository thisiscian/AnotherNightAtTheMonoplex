0	You start to talk to the person at the desk, but several of the people in the queue start to give you strange looks. You hope you haven't startled these bland-os with your wild and intriguing nature. The clerk stops tendering tickets and money to say to you "I'm sorry, but you'll have to join the queue, just like every other establishment you've ever been to". You think to yourself, that's pretty reasonable, given the current social climate.
1 You start to get flustered. You didn't even look at the timetable. You have no idea what is showing. How could you make such a bland, rookie error? A cold sweat begins to creep you out. You realise, with shame, that it is your own cold sweat. "Sorry", you mumble, "I forgot what films are on..." You bust out of the queue, just in time to not make a scene.
2 The clerk barely looks up, they seem to be busy with some money. "Sorry, about that", they say, " what film would you like to watch?" [[check:filmchoice;"Okay, that'll be a fiver, please."|"Wrong! I saw you pick out a film over there earlier! I don't like indecisive punks like you. Just like my ex. You're going to stick with that film you chose FOREVER!"]][[remove:money=5]][[add:ticket=1]]
